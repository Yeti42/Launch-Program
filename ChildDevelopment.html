WHAT ABOUT THOSE EARLY LEARNERS?
Before you begin to work with your Launch student, you may find yourself asking, "What are they like? What can they do? How do they learn?" Hopefully, the research in this section will help you to understand what experts in the field have discovered about the 5-7-year-old child.

WHAT ARE THEY LIKE AND WHAT CAN THEY DO? 
The world has changed but child development has not. Kindergartners and First Graders tend to be active and energetic, curious about the world around them and apt to tire easily. Their thinking is grounded in the concrete, and although they are beginning to use symbols, they cannot think abstractly. They often confuse reality and fantasy.
In Piaget's stages of mental development, he lists 2–7-year-olds as pre-operational with these characteristics:
1.	Cannot perform such mental operations as: adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing; correspondence, placing in order.
2.	Cannot do certain infra logical operations such as: observing, measuring, classifying; yet to establish values and still to learn how to get along with others and notice the effects of their behavior on others.
3.	Stimulus limited.
4.	Centers on one property or aspect of change.
5.	Thought processes are not reversible.
6.	Play and reality confused.
7.	Egocentric.
8.	Time — thinks present, future, past but limited to short duration.
9.	Space — house, yard, neighborhood.

HOW DO THEY LEARN?
All people, not just Kindergartners and First Graders, learn in a variety of ways. The games in this manual are designed to accommodate the visual learner, the auditory learner, and the kinesthetic learner. It is important to understand these learning styles to discover which modality will best reach your special learner. Here is what to look for:

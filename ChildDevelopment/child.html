            <h3>HOW DO THEY LEARN?</h3>
            All people, not just Kindergartners and First Graders, learn in a variety of ways. The games in this manual
            are designed to accommodate the visual learner, the auditory learner, and the kinesthetic learner. It is
            important to understand these learning styles to discover which modality will best reach your special
            learner. Here is what to look for:
            <h4>Visual Learners — learn by watching and seeing, whether by pictures, diagrams, verb descriptions or imagined
            scenes.</h4>
            READING — like descriptions because they can imagine the scene; staring into space can indicate extreme
            involvement.<br>
            HANDWRITING — generally good in size and spacing.<br>
            IMAGINATION — very good imagination, visualize in detail while thinking.<br>
            COMMUNICATION — are quiet, but responsive, describe things simply and cannot listen for a lengthy
            period.<br>
            RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR — aware of the environment, observe everything, doodles, facial expression reveals
            feelings.<br>
            PERSONAL APPEARANCE — neat and clean, usually does not vary in dress style.
            <h4>Auditory Learners — can hear directions and learn from them.</h4>
            READING — prefer few pictures or descriptions, when reading a story like conversation or dialogue.<br>
            HANDWRITING — have difficulty learning to write, verbalize the strokes while writing.<br>
            IMAGINATION — think in sounds, details are not important.<br>
            COMMUNICATION — love to talk and talk constantly, are repetitive, interrupts others frequently, like the
            sound of their own voice.<br>
            RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR — talk to themselves, and sometimes answer; are very verbal; show emotion through tone
            quality, pitch, or voice as well as other sounds.<br>
            PERSONAL APPEARANCE — the clothes are not important, but they can tell you why those clothes are being
            worn.
            <h4>Kinesthetic Learners — These people are hands-on learners. Their motto is "We learn by doing!"</h4>
            READING — like action from the first page on, find it difficult to sit still while reading, don't
            particularly like reading.<br>
            HANDWRITING — push hard on writing utensils, usually have short pencils, and have difficulty writing in
            small spaces.<br>
            IMAGINATION — visualize only with movement.<br>
            COMMUNICATION — use many hand gestures, don't like to listen, hard to hold their attention.<br>
            RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR — are fidgety, in constant movement, can't stay in their seat, touch everything, act out
            stories, must try everything, hug, pull, jump, stamp, crawl etc. Constantly seeking tactile feedback.<br>
            PERSONAL APPEARANCE — start out neat but end up with a rumpled appearance.<br>

            <h3>WHAT ARE THEY LIKE AND WHAT CAN THEY DO?</h3>
            The world has changed but child development has not. Kindergartners and First Graders tend to be active and
            energetic, curious about the world around them and apt to tire easily. Their thinking is grounded in the
            concrete, and although they are beginning to use symbols, they cannot think abstractly. They often confuse
            reality and fantasy.<br><br>
            In Piaget's stages of mental development, he lists 2–7-year-olds as pre-operational with these
            characteristics:<br>
            <ol>
                <li>Cannot perform such mental operations as: adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing;
                    correspondence, placing in order.</li>
                <li>Cannot do certain infra logical operations such as: observing, measuring, classifying; yet to
                    establish values and still to learn how to get along with others and notice the effects of their
                    behavior on others.</li>
                <li>Stimulus limited.
                <li>Centers on one property or aspect of change.
                <li>Thought processes are not reversible.
                <li>Play and reality confused.
                <li>Egocentric.
                <li>Time — thinks present, future, past but limited to short duration.
                <li>Space — house, yard, neighborhood.
            </ol>
            Other experts on the kindergarten child from Student Profile, Lake Washington School District, Kirkland,
            Washington; and Kindergarten Curriculum Guide, Ministry of Education, British Columbia, Canada draw a
            portrait with these characteristics:<br>

HOW DO THEY LEARN?
All people, not just Kindergartners and First Graders, learn in a variety of ways. The games in this manual are designed to accommodate the visual learner, the auditory learner, and the kinesthetic learner. It is important to understand these learning styles to discover which modality will best reach your special learner. Here is what to look for:
Visual Learners — learn by watching and seeing, whether by pictures, diagrams, verb descriptions or imagined scenes.
READING — like descriptions because they can imagine the scene; staring into space can indicate extreme involvement.
HANDWRITING — generally good in size and spacing.
IMAGINATION — very good imagination, visualize in detail while thinking.
COMMUNICATION — are quiet, but responsive, describe things simply and cannot listen for a lengthy period.
RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR — aware of the environment, observe everything, doodles, facial expression reveals feelings.
PERSONAL APPEARANCE — neat and clean, usually does not vary in dress style.
Auditory Learners — can hear directions and learn from them.
READING — prefer few pictures or descriptions, when reading a story like conversation or dialogue.
HANDWRITING — have difficulty learning to write, verbalize the strokes while writing.
IMAGINATION — think in sounds, details are not important.
COMMUNICATION — love to talk and talk constantly, are repetitive, interrupts others frequently, like the sound of their own voice.
RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR — talk to themselves, and sometimes answer; are very verbal; show emotion through tone quality, pitch, or voice as well as other sounds.
PERSONAL APPEARANCE — the clothes are not important, but they can tell you why those clothes are being worn.
Kinesthetic Learners — These people are hands-on learners. Their motto is "We learn by doing!"
READING — like action from the first page on, find it difficult to sit still while reading, don't particularly like reading.
HANDWRITING — push hard on writing utensils, usually have short pencils, and have difficulty writing in small spaces.

            <h2>A 1: SPIN A RHYME</h2>
            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>To provide practice in making words that rhyme.</p>
            <h4>Materials:</h4>
            <p>Draw two large circles onto a piece of tagboard. Divide each circle into 8 sections. On the first circle
                print beginning consonant letters, on the second circle print the following word endings: ing, ink, all,
                ad, ane, oil, ill, ock. Attach a spinner to each circle.</p>
            <h4>Procedure:</h4>
            <p>Start by just using the beginning consonant letter spinner. Leave the other spinner on one-word endings,
                changing the word ending spinner after every 10 spins. Each player takes a turn to spin the first
                spinner. Player must say the word spun by combining the beginning consonant with the word ending (Tutor
                identifies the ending). They must then tell if their word is a real word or a nonsense word. One point
                is scored for each real word. The player with the most points at the end of a designated time wins.</p>
            <h4>Variation:</h4>
            <p>Have the players use both spinners after word endings are familiar.</p>

            <h2>A 2: DO WE RHYME?</h2>
            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>To practice listening for words that rhyme.</p>
            <h4>Materials:</h4>
            <p>List of rhyming words and non-rhyming words. (See attached list.)</p>
            <h4>Procedure:</h4>
            <p>Volunteer reads two words aloud from the prepared list.</p>
            <p>Child claps their hands if the two words rhyme and if not, puts their hands flat on the table and waits
                for the volunteer to read two more words. A star, or happy face, or sticker could be given for each
                correct answer.</p>

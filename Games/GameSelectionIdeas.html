			<p>LRS Bucket.</p>
			<p>Launch & Learn Beginning Sounds. To play, give a picture mat to the student. Set up the tile dispenser and place the letter tiles inside. Student “launches” a tile and places it on the picture that begins with the same letter as that tile e.g., “G” on “Goat.” </p>
			<p>Reading lesson books.</p>
			<p>The I-Spy Game: give the student a game card and tell them to look for an item beginning with a particular letter. For example, if you want them to find a book, say “I spy something beginning with b.”</p>
			<p>Phonics bean bags: play catch with the student. Have them identify the item on the bean bag and say what letter it begins with. </p>
			<p>The Racetrack game (N7 in the Numbers Bin) can be customized to be used with beginning letters. Use the index cards from the tutor bucket to make your track or use cards from the letter picture box. </p>
			<p>Ping Pong Toss (N22 in the Numbers Bin) - use the stickers in the tutor bucket to write the targeted letter sounds and place them at the bottom of the cups. </p>
			<p>Use letter picture cards/trinkets.</p>

			<h2>What Games Can I Use for Numbers in the Teens? </h2>
			<p>Teens are one of the most difficult concepts for young students to grasp. Often a child may be able to “count” to 100, but in the same way that singing the ABC song does not mean that the child knows and recognizes all the letters, being able to recite numbers 1-100 does not necessarily mean that the child understands what they mean. It is particularly important that students understand that numbers 11:19 are made up of one block of 10 + units. For example, 13 = 1 block of 10 and 3 units.</p>
			<p>Using Ten Frame cards (in the tutor buckets) can be a helpful visual tool: </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>There are several other activities and games that can be used to work on this concept, as well as games offering practice with counting and number recognition:</p>
			<p>Abacus.</p>
			<p>Unifix cubes: colorful cubes that come in blocks of 10 and can be broken apart to make units.</p>
			<p>Numbers Bin - N2 Cars; N4 Baseball; N5 Teen Solitaire; N6 Bang; N7 Racetrack; N10 Calendar Match Up; N16 Calendar Toss; N21 Greater Than Pops; N22 Ping Pong Toss.</p>
			<p>Numbers Bingo.</p>
			<p>1-50 Ten Frame Puzzle Cards.</p>

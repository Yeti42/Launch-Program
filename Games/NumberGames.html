            <h2>N 1: RACKO</h2>
            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>Sequencing</p>
            <h4>Materials:</h4>
            <p>Number cards</p>
            <h4>Procedure:</h4>
            <p>Shuffle numbers so they are not in order. Place the pile of cards in the center of the table. Each player
                draws one card at a time (for a total of 5 cards) and places it in front of themself in a vertical row
                (like a ladder) in their numerical order.</p>
            <p>The game begins by taking the next card from the center pile and deciding where on the ladder it fits
                most appropriately. They then insert the card into its proper place in the ladder and discard the number
                they removed. The next player may take the discarded number or may draw from the center pile. Play
                continues until one player has all their numbers in order. (Need not be adjacent.)</p>
            <h4>Variation:</h4>
            <p>Begin with sequencing 3 numbers and use numbers 1-5 in the draw pile. Add numbers as the child's
                awareness grows.</p>

            <h2>N 2: CARS</h2>
            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>To review beginning sounds or numbers or color words.</p>
            <h4>Materials:</h4>
            <p>Cut out 30 cars. Write letters or numbers on 24 of the cars and write "CRASH" on six of the cars. Draw
                rumpled fenders on the "CRASH" cars. Laminate the cards for durability.</p>
            <h4>Procedure:</h4>
            <p>All the cards are placed with letters or numbers and "CRASH" face down. First player begins by choosing a
                car and reading the letter or number. If read correctly, they are entitled to choose another car. They
                continue to choose cars until they either miss a letter or they choose a "CRASH" car. Then the next
                player takes a turn. The player with the most cars is the winner.</p>

            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>To reinforce numbers.</p>
            <h4>Materials:</h4>
            <p>List of numbers that need reinforcing, paper, and pencil</p>
            <h4>Procedure:</h4>
            <p>Have the child sit with their back to you. Using the selected number needing reinforcing, draw the number
                on their back writing with your index finger. Then have the child write the letter or number you have
                drawn on a piece of paper. Take turns and let them write on your back.</p>

            <h2>N 4: BASEBALL</h2>
            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>For quicker recall of color or number words. Good for reviewing sight words.</p>
            <h4>Materials:</h4>
            <p>Baseball diamonds drawn on manila folder, markers, words, and dice.</p>
            <h4>Procedure:</h4>
            <p>Establish the number of outs to be played in the game. (Could pick 5 to 10 outs depending on the amount
                of time.) Player throws the dice. If 1, 2, 3, or 4 is thrown, the player reads a word (flashed to them
                by the tutor) from the pile designated 1, 2, 3, or 4 (of word cards). They then move their marker the
                same number of bases. (The word can be flashed quickly at first. If the player does not know the word
                flashed quickly, it may be flashed slower. If they still do not know it, the tutor may help them. When a
                word is read, the player may move the number of bases indicated.)</p>
            <p>If a player shakes a 5 or 6 on a dice, it is counted as an OUT and one OUT mark is placed on the
                scoreboard. Game is over when the number of outs stated in the beginning is reached. Every time a player
                passes home base, a run is scored for that player. The winner is the player who has the most runs scored
                before the last out is made.</p>

            <h2>N 5: TEEN SOLITAIRE</h2>
            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>Reinforce recognition of numbers 11-19; sequencing.</p>
            <h4>Materials:</h4>
            <p>4 laminated cards for each of the numbers 11-19.</p>
            <h4>Procedure:</h4>
            <p>Deal in a line eight stacks of four cards each, all face down. These stacks will represent the numbers
                12-19. Place four cards above the line. The object of the game is to have all the cards lined up in
                their correct order, face up 12-19, before all four 11 s are revealed.</p>
            <p>Beginning with the top pile, turn over a card and put it face up at the bottom of the correct pile. Then
                take a card from that pile and place it in its correct place and so on. When there are no more cards
                left in a pile, take a card from the top and continue, until the stacks are all completed, 12-19, or all
                the 11s are revealed.</p>
            <p>Example: If the first card drawn from the top is "12", put it at the bottom of the first stack of cards,
                and then take a card from the "12s" pile and put that card where it belongs.</p>
            <p>If the game works out, all eight piles of cards numbered 12-19 will have been uncovered before all the
                11s are revealed. If the 11s are revealed first, the game is lost.</p>
            <p>If this is too frustrating/complicated for your student, deal nine stacks of four cards and if a pile
                runs out, just take from the next available pile.</p>

            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>To reinforce numbers and number words.</p>
            <h4>Materials:</h4>
            <p>Coffee can or box decorated with the word "BANG" on the outside of the can or box. Number and number word
                cards. Three or four cards that say "BANG". All cards should be the same size and color.</p>
            <h4>Procedure:</h4>
            <p>Have the student say the number or number word. If they are correct, they may keep the card. Take turns
                to see who can get the most cards. When a person draws the "BANG" card, they must put all their cards
                back in the can.</p>

            <p>2 matchbox type cars and one dice.</p>
            <h4>Procedure:</h4>
            <p>Lay the cards on the floor to form a racetrack. Place both cars at the beginning. The first player rolls
                the die and moves their car along as many cards as the die indicates. They must correctly say the
                letter, number, or color word they land on in order to stay there. Players alternate turns. The first

            <h4>Materials:</h4>
            <p>Double set of number cards (1-12)</p>
            <h4>Procedure:</h4>
            <p>Divide one set of cards between the two players. Each player places their cards face up in 2 rows in
                front of them. This becomes their "Lotto Card".</p>
            <p>Place the other identical set of cards spread out face down in front of the players. The first player
                draws a card, reads it aloud and looks to see if they have that number on their "Lotto Card". If they
                do, they cover the number with that card and then draw another card and proceed the same way. If they
                don't have the number, they must give the card to the other player to place face down over the number on
                their "Lotto Card". Then the other player does the drawing until they can't place a number on their
                "Lotto Card". The first player to cover all the numbers on their "Lotto Card" wins.</p>

            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>To recognize numerals and numbers (to practice simple addition and subtraction); to practice fine motor
                skills and number sequencing.)</p>
            <h4>Materials:</h4>
            <p>Tagboard squares (4 x 4) with numerals 0-10 printed on them. Under the numerals use a paper punch to

            <h4>Procedure:</h4>
            <p>Ask the child to say the numeral, feel the number of holes and clip enough paper clips on the card to
                correspond with the numeral on the card. The cards could also be used for simple addition. Or ask the
                child to put the cards in sequence.</p>

            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>To reinforce number recognition, (alphabet recognition, match uppercase to lowercase).</p>
            <h4>Materials:</h4>
            <p>Divide a cardboard into 12 squares (3 across and 4 down).</p>
            <p>Place the numbers 1 - 12 in the squares not in sequence.</p>

            <h4>Procedure:</h4>
            <p>Place the 2 free squares face-up on any numbers on the grid. Place the other squares face-up any place on
                the grid (do not match numbers). You will have 2 small number squares left.</p>
            <p>Begin play by lifting one "free" square exposing the number under it. Find the square that matches that
                number and place it on the matching number. This should show a new number for which you will find a
                matching number. Play continues until you use your extra numbers, at which point you will be stuck. Then
                lift the other "free" square and continue playing until you are forced to use your second extra square.
                This will be the end of the game. To win you will get all the numbers to match before being forced to
                use your last square.</p>
            <h4>Variations:</h4>
            <p>Place letters of the alphabet written in lower case on the grid and upper case on the squares.</p>

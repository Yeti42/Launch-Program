            <h2>S 1: Word Work Folder Games</h2>
            <h4>Flower Garden:</h4>
            <p>Take all the plastic chips out of the storage pouch. Spin the spinner to find the sight word. Place the chip on the flower that matches the sight word you spun.</p>
            <h4>Match Game.</h4>
            <p>Place the tiles sight word down on the board. Flip the tiles to find matching pairs. If they do not match, flip them back over. Continue until all pairs are matched.</p>

            <h4>Buzzing Around.</h4>
            <p>Sort all the tiles so that the picture sides are face up. Student chooses a tile and places it in the word family where it best fits (corresponding rhyme). Flip the tile over to check if you are right.</p>
            <h4>Elephant Lineup.</h4>
            <p>Sort the tiles so that the letter-only sides face up. Use the tiles to spell the word pictured on the game board. Flip the tiles over to check the answers.</p>
            <h4>Wood Work.</h4>
            <p>Sort the tiles so that the letter-only sides face up. Use the tiles to spell the word pictured on the game board. Flip the tiles over to check the answers.</p>
            <h4>Let’s Celebrate.</h4>

            <h4>Make the Grade Simple Sentences.</h4>
            <p>Sort all the tiles so that the pictures face up. Read the sentence on the game board. Find the word that best finishes the sentence and place the tile where it belongs.</p>
            <h4>Refrigerator Match-Ups Simple Sentences.</h4>
            <p>Sort all the tiles so that the pictures face up. Read the sentence on the game board. Find the word that best finishes the sentence and place the tile where it belongs.</p>

            <h2>S 2: Roll and Write</h2>
        
            <p>The student rolls one die onto the game board.</p>
            <p>They then say words by combining the beginning sound on the die with the word family endings it touches on the game board.</p>
            <p>Next, have them write the words on their game card.</p>
            <p>Example: student rolls the letter “p,” and it touches the endings –ine, -est, -oke, and –an. Student writes pine, pest, poke and pan on their card.</p>
            <p>They win the game when their card is full.</p>

            <p>The box contains 30 different little books, each focusing on END sounds. Each book has 10 pictures to go with each sound, and the student flips the book to make different words. Great for rhyming practice and works with various reading levels. Examples of end sounds are –in, -ap, - ock.</p>

            <p>Student picks one card from the top of the sight words deck and says the word aloud. If they are correct, they roll the die and pop down the number of bubbles which they rolled on the die. If they are incorrect, they do not pop any bubbles.</p>
            <p>If the student gets the Unicorn Card, they get to roll the die twice without having to identify a sight word.</p>
            <p>If the student gets the Gremlin Card, they must roll the die and unpop the number of bubbles they rolled on the die.</p>
            <p>When the student pops all their bubbles, they shout Unicorn! They win the game.</p>

            <h4>Space Race.</h4>
            <p>Give the student a rocket and lay out all the cards so the student can see them. Set a timer and have the student find pairs of cards that rhyme and put them into the rocket. See how many they find in the time.</p>
            <h4>Rare Air.</h4>
            <p>Show the student three picture cards (two that rhyme and one that does not). Say to the student, “Two of these words rhyme and one does not rhyme. Show me which one does not rhyme with the others.” Then have the student put the non-rhyming word into a rocket.</p>
            <h4>Auditory Astronauts.</h4>

            <h4>Flower Garden:</h4>
            <p>Take all the plastic chips out of the storage pouch. Spin the spinner to find the sight word. Place the
                chip on the flower that matches the sight word you spun.</p>
            <h4>Match Game.</h4>
            <p>Place the tiles sight word down on the board. Flip the tiles to find matching pairs. If they do not
                match, flip them back over. Continue until all pairs are matched.</p>
            <h4>Circus Town.</h4>
            <p>Place the pawn on Start. Spin the spinner to find your word pattern. Move the pawn to the closest space
                that matches your word pattern. For example, spinner lands on “ake.” Student should move the pawn to
                “rake.” Keep going until the student finds all the words that rhyme with the chosen word pattern.</p>
            <h4>Buzzing Around.</h4>
            <p>Sort all the tiles so that the picture sides are face up. Student chooses a tile and places it in the
                word family where it best fits (corresponding rhyme). Flip the tile over to check if you are right.</p>
            <h4>Elephant Lineup.</h4>
            <p>Sort the tiles so that the letter-only sides face up. Use the tiles to spell the word pictured on the
                game board. Flip the tiles over to check the answers.</p>
            <h4>Wood Work.</h4>
            <p>Sort the tiles so that the letter-only sides face up. Use the tiles to spell the word pictured on the
                game board. Flip the tiles over to check the answers.</p>
            <h4>Let’s Celebrate.</h4>
            <p>Sort the tiles so that the pictures face up. Place the gift next to its matching word. Flip the gift over
                to check the answers.</p>
            <h4>Going Sailing.</h4>
            <p>Sort the tiles so that the pictures face up. Place the tile on the sailboat that matches. Flip the tiles
                over to check the answers.</p>
            <h4>Make the Grade Simple Sentences.</h4>
            <p>Sort all the tiles so that the pictures face up. Read the sentence on the game board. Find the word that
                best finishes the sentence and place the tile where it belongs.</p>
            <h4>Refrigerator Match-Ups Simple Sentences.</h4>
            <p>Sort all the tiles so that the pictures face up. Read the sentence on the game board. Find the word that
                best finishes the sentence and place the tile where it belongs.</p>

            <h2>S 2: Roll and Write</h2>

            <p>The student rolls one die onto the game board.</p>
            <p>They then say words by combining the beginning sound on the die with the word family endings it touches
                on the game board.</p>
            <p>Next, have them write the words on their game card.</p>
            <p>Example: student rolls the letter “p,” and it touches the endings –ine, -est, -oke, and –an. Student
                writes pine, pest, poke and pan on their card.</p>
            <p>They win the game when their card is full.</p>

            <p>The box contains 30 different little books, each focusing on END sounds. Each book has 10 pictures to go
                with each sound, and the student flips the book to make different words. Great for rhyming practice and
                works with various reading levels. Examples of end sounds are –in, -ap, - ock.</p>

                face down on the table. Give the student a rainbow fidget toy mat.</p>
            <p>Student picks one card from the top of the sight words deck and says the word aloud. If they are correct,
                they roll the die and pop down the number of bubbles which they rolled on the die. If they are
                incorrect, they do not pop any bubbles.</p>
            <p>If the student gets the Unicorn Card, they get to roll the die twice without having to identify a sight
                word.</p>
            <p>If the student gets the Gremlin Card, they must roll the die and unpop the number of bubbles they rolled
                on the die.</p>
            <p>When the student pops all their bubbles, they shout Unicorn! They win the game.</p>

            <h4>Liftoff!</h4>
            <p>Set up the rockets (as many or as few as you decide) on the table. Place one rhyming card in each rocket,
                by the base. Lay out the remaining cards and have the student sort them into the correct rockets.</p>
            <h4>Space Race.</h4>
            <p>Give the student a rocket and lay out all the cards so the student can see them. Set a timer and have the

            <p>Show the student three picture cards (two that rhyme and one that does not). Say to the student, “Two of
                these words rhyme and one does not rhyme. Show me which one does not rhyme with the others.” Then have
                the student put the non-rhyming word into a rocket.</p>
            <h4>Auditory Astronauts.</h4>
            <p>Give the student a rocket. Set out three cards in front of the student and say a word from the list of

            <h4>Cosmic Consonants.</h4>
            <p>Give the student a rocket. Set out three cards in front of the student. Say “I’m thinking of a word. It
                starts with (for example) “b” and rhymes with (for example) “sat.” If the student thinks one of their
                cards rhymes with the word, they announce that word and, if correct, place it in their rocket.</p>

            <h2>S 24: Monkey Balance</h2>
            <p>This game is helpful for working on number recognition, number-object
                correspondence and basic addition skills. It consists of a monkey scale, 30
                double-sided color-coded cards, 19 plastic monkeys and plastic numbers 1-
                10.</p>
            <p>To play, first assemble the scale and then decide which color cards to use.</p>
            <p>Green cards are for number recognition and number-object
                correspondence. Balance the scale according to the number shown.</p>
            <p>Purple cards are “counting” cards and have either monkeys or numbers on
                them. Place the number of monkeys on one side of the scale and the child
                will aim to balance the scale by placing the correct digit or the right number
                of monkeys on the other side.</p>
            <p>Blue cards are for working on addition skills. If the card is a number card,
                e.g. 2+3, put the 2 and 3 on one side of the scale. The child will then
                balance the scale by placing 5 monkeys on the other side.</p>
            <p>If it is a monkey card, put the corresponding number of monkeys on one
                side of the scale and have the child balance the scale by choosing the
                correct number(s).</p>
            <p>If it is a combo card with monkeys and numbers on it, put both on one side
                of the scale and have the child balance the scale by using monkeys,
                numbers or a combination of both.</p>

            <h2>That’s a Word! Sight Word Game</h2>
            <p>This game features sight word cards and pop-up dice. The cards have a
                picture of an object on one side, and the corresponding word, minus a
                letter, on the other side. The cards are color-coded according to degree of

            <p>There are 2 suggested ways to play:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a card. Have the child read and remember the word. Next,
                    the child flips the card over and writes the missing letter. Then they
                    look at the dice and pop up the word they have just written.</li>
                <li>The child rolls the dice and identifies the word on it. Next, they find
                    the corresponding word on a card, read it and remember it. Lastly,

            <h2>Beginning, Middle &amp; End Sound Games</h2>
            <p>There are 3 separate boxes to target beginning, middle and end sounds.
                Each game box contains 24 write and wipe game mats, 6 each of 4
                different colors coded to one of the four different poppers, and 4 poppers.</p>
            <p>Begin by having the child choose a game mat. Explain that the object of the
                game is to complete the five words on their mat. Have the child identify the
                word for each picture and tell the child that these are the words they are
                going to try and build.</p>
            <p>Next, the child presses the popper to roll the die. They identify the letter
                and sound that they have rolled and see if they can use it to complete a
                word on their card. If so, they write the letter on their card using a dry erase
                marker. If at any time the die roll shows “WILD,” the child can build any
                word on their mat.</p>
            <p>When they have built all the words, they have won!</p>

            <p>This activity consists of 44 double-sided sound tiles, 44 divider cards, 220 double-sided picture cards
                (5 for each sound tile), 3 “No” tiles and 6 sorting trays. The sound tiles are color-coded by category:
                consonants, short vowels, digraphs (e.g., sh, th, ng), long vowels, diphthongs (e.g., oi, ou, aw), and
                r-controlled vowels (e.g., ar, er, or).</p>
            <p>For beginning sounds, choose a consonant sound tile, e.g., “b” and a "no" tile. Scatter some picture
                tiles, including all those beginning with "b," on the table. Place two sorting trays side by side, with
                the "b" sound tile at the top of one, and a “no” tile on the top of the other. Have the student sort the
                tiles into the correct tray. More sound tiles and sorting trays can be added for practice in
                differentiating sounds.</p>
            <p>The same procedure can be used for short vowels, digraphs, etc.</p>

            <h2>Blah! Blah! Blah!</h2>
            <p>The object of the game is to match sounds on the cards in your hand with the card shown on the table. The
                winner is the first to get rid of all their cards.</p>
            <p>Begin by selecting a level to work at:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Green</b>: Matching single letter sounds, for example, match the ‘b’ in bed with the ‘b’ in bin.
                </li>
                <li><b>Purple</b>: Consists of double vowels, e.g., "oi," etc.</li>
                <li><b>Pink</b>: Consists of blends, digraphs, and sound-alikes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Next, deal 5-7 cards to the student and yourself. Place one card face up on the table and place the rest
                of the deck in a pile, face down.</p>
            <p>Have the student look at their cards and see if they can play a card from their hand that has a sound
                matching one of the sounds on the card shown. If they cannot play a card, have them draw a card from the
                face-down pile. If they still cannot make a match, it is your turn. When a player has just one card
                left, they must say “Blah! Blah! Blah!” If they forget, they must draw 4 new cards.</p>
            <p>You can add difficulty/interest to the game by including the special cards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ha Ha</b>: The other player must draw 2 new cards.</li>
                <li><b>Ha Ha Ha Ha</b>: The other player must draw 4 new cards.</li>
                <li><b>Wah Wah Wah</b>: The other player must miss a turn.</li>

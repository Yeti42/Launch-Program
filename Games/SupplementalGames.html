            <h2>S 1: Word Work Folder Games</h2>
            <h4>Flower Garden:</h4>
            <p>Take all the plastic chips out of the storage pouch. Spin the spinner to find the sight word. Place the chip on the flower that matches the sight word you spun.</p>
            <h4>Match Game.</h4>
            <p>Place the tiles sight word down on the board. Flip the tiles to find matching pairs. If they do not match, flip them back over. Continue until all pairs are matched.</p>
            <h4>Circus Town.</h4>
            <p>Place the pawn on Start. Spin the spinner to find your word pattern. Move the pawn to the closest space that matches your word pattern. For example, spinner lands on “ake.” Student should move the pawn to “rake.” Keep going until the student finds all the words that rhyme with the chosen word pattern.</p>
            <h4>Buzzing Around.</h4>
            <p>Sort all the tiles so that the picture sides are face up. Student chooses a tile and places it in the word family where it best fits (corresponding rhyme). Flip the tile over to check if you are right.</p>
            <h4>Elephant Lineup.</h4>
            <p>Sort the tiles so that the letter-only sides face up. Use the tiles to spell the word pictured on the game board. Flip the tiles over to check the answers.</p>
            <h4>Wood Work.</h4>
            <p>Sort the tiles so that the letter-only sides face up. Use the tiles to spell the word pictured on the game board. Flip the tiles over to check the answers.</p>
            <h4>Let’s Celebrate.</h4>
            <p>Sort the tiles so that the pictures face up. Place the gift next to its matching word. Flip the gift over to check the answers.</p>
            <h4>Going Sailing.</h4>
            <p>Sort the tiles so that the pictures face up. Place the tile on the sailboat that matches. Flip the tiles over to check the answers.</p>
            <h4>Make the Grade Simple Sentences.</h4>
            <p>Sort all the tiles so that the pictures face up. Read the sentence on the game board. Find the word that best finishes the sentence and place the tile where it belongs.</p>
            <h4>Refrigerator Match-Ups Simple Sentences.</h4>
            <p>Sort all the tiles so that the pictures face up. Read the sentence on the game board. Find the word that best finishes the sentence and place the tile where it belongs.</p>

            <h2>S 2: Roll and Write</h2>
        
            <p>The student rolls one die onto the game board.</p>
            <p>They then say words by combining the beginning sound on the die with the word family endings it touches on the game board.</p>
            <p>Next, have them write the words on their game card.</p>
            <p>Example: student rolls the letter “p,” and it touches the endings –ine, -est, -oke, and –an. Student writes pine, pest, poke and pan on their card.</p>
            <p>They win the game when their card is full.</p>

            <h2>S 3: Word Family Flip Books</h2>
        
            <p>The box contains 30 different little books, each focusing on END sounds. Each book has 10 pictures to go with each sound, and the student flips the book to make different words. Great for rhyming practice and works with various reading levels. Examples of end sounds are –in, -ap, - ock.</p>

            <p>Select a word card.</p>
            <p>First have the student touch the textured dots as they say each sound individually.</p>
            <p>Then have them use the arrow to blend the sounds together and read the full word. </p>
            <p>Next have them find its matching picture card.</p>

            <h2>S 5: The Fidget Game</h2>
        
            <p>Choose a deck of sight word cards to work with according to the ability of the student. Place the deck face down on the table. Give the student a rainbow fidget toy mat.</p>
            <p>Student picks one card from the top of the sight words deck and says the word aloud. If they are correct, they roll the die and pop down the number of bubbles which they rolled on the die. If they are incorrect, they do not pop any bubbles.</p>
            <p>If the student gets the Unicorn Card, they get to roll the die twice without having to identify a sight word.</p>
            <p>If the student gets the Gremlin Card, they must roll the die and unpop the number of bubbles they rolled on the die.</p>
            <p>When the student pops all their bubbles, they shout Unicorn! They win the game.</p>

            <p>The student chooses a game board.</p>
            <p>Next, they spin the spinner and say what letter it lands on.</p>
            <p>Then they search their game board to find an object that begins with that letter. When they have found something, they put a jigsaw puzzle piece over that item.</p>
            <p>Repeat the process until the board is covered and the jigsaw puzzle is complete.</p>

            <h2>S 7: Rhyme & Sort Rockets</h2>
        
            <h4>Liftoff!</h4>
            <p>Set up the rockets (as many or as few as you decide) on the table. Place one rhyming card in each rocket, by the base. Lay out the remaining cards and have the student sort them into the correct rockets.</p>
            <h4>Space Race.</h4>
            <p>Give the student a rocket and lay out all the cards so the student can see them. Set a timer and have the student find pairs of cards that rhyme and put them into the rocket. See how many they find in the time.</p>
            <h4>Rare Air.</h4>
            <p>Show the student three picture cards (two that rhyme and one that does not). Say to the student, “Two of these words rhyme and one does not rhyme. Show me which one does not rhyme with the others.” Then have the student put the non-rhyming word into a rocket.</p>
            <h4>Auditory Astronauts.</h4>
            <p>Give the student a rocket. Set out three cards in front of the student and say a word from the list of rhyming words. The student puts picture cards that rhyme with the word into their rocket.</p>
            <h4>Cosmic Consonants.</h4>
            <p>Give the student a rocket. Set out three cards in front of the student. Say “I’m thinking of a word. It starts with (for example) “b” and rhymes with (for example) “sat.” If the student thinks one of their cards rhymes with the word, they announce that word and, if correct, place it in their rocket.</p>

            <p>Place the tiles in the dispenser and have the student choose a game mat.</p>
            <p>Then the student launches a tile from the dispenser and identifies the letter and the beginning sound it makes. Next, they place it on the corresponding spot on their game mat, matching the picture to the beginning sound.</p>

            <p>The student chooses a picture card and identifies the object on it.</p>
            <p>Then they snap clips onto the board, sound by sound, to spell the corresponding word correctly.</p>
            <p>Example: picture is a bee. Student clips a “b” and “ee” onto the board.</p>

            <p>If you draw a “Splash!” return your cards to the box. Place the “Splash!” in the discard pile.</p>
            <p>Keep playing until one player has 10 cards (or however many cards you decide). The first to 10 is the winner.</p>

<p>Begin play by lifting one "free" square exposing the number under it. Find the square that matches that number and place it on the matching number. This should show a new number for which you will find a matching number. Play continues until you use one of your extra numbers at which point you will be stuck. Then lift the other "free" square and continue playing until you are forced to use your second extra square. This will be the end of the game.

<h2>LRS 25: BEGINNING SOUND GAME</h2>
<h4>Purpose:</h4>
<p>Beginning sounds or ending sounds.</p>
<h4>Materials:</h4>
<p>Take 2 pieces of tagboard (10" square) and divide each into 25- 2"x2" squares. Paste a small picture of an item with a beginning sound in each square. An old kindergarten workbook of sounds is a useful source for pictures.</p>
<p>Cut about 60 small tagboard squares (14/4" x 1-1/4") and write the consonants on them. Practice only 5-8 consonants at a time.</p>
<h4>Procedure:</h4>
<p>Each player takes a large picture card. Place the small letter cards face down in the center of the table. The first player draws a letter card and places it on a picture that has that beginning sound. The next player takes a turn. Play continues until one player has 5 letters in a row across, up and down, or diagonally. (The game can be varied by playing until one person fills their card.) If a player cannot place a letter, they put it back in the pile and miss their turn. The first player with 5 in a row (or a full card) is the winner.</p>
<h4>Variations:</h4>
<p>This same principle can be used for an Ending Sound Game.</p>

            <h3>"LAUNCH" PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
            The Launch Program is a volunteer tutoring program designed to help kindergarten and first grade children
            become
            more comfortable with number and letter recognition, beginning sounds, blends & digraphs, CVC
            (consonant-vowel-consonant) words, and other pre reading and reading activities. The program supports the
            teacher to
            ensure each child is 'launched' on an educational path to success.
            The Launch volunteer meets twice weekly for 15 minutes with each child. Skills are reinforced in a
            comfortable
            one-to-one setting using multi-sensory games carried by the volunteer. A communication notebook allows the
            teacher
            and volunteer to confidentially share insights and record progress.
            This program has been successful in other schools as it combines several essential features:
            <ol>
                <li>Prevention - It is a program designed to help children who are identified by their classroom teacher
                    as needing a
                    boost. The emphasis is on twice-a-week, immediate help, before bad habits become firmly established.
                </li>
                <li>Training - Volunteers are required to take a training class with a building professional. This
                    training provides
                    the volunteer with an overview of learning differences, tutoring techniques, and the importance of
                    helping children
                    develop a positive self-image.</li>
                <li>Materials - The volunteers' supplies are hand-made games and aids which the well-trained volunteer
                    uses
                    creatively by adapting them to the individual needs of the child. Teacher preparation time is
                    alleviated due to the
                    autonomous nature of the program.</li>
                <li>Support - The volunteers meet regularly with the Launch Coordinator in their school. This
                    opportunity to exchange
                    new ideas and concerns provides volunteer stimulation and ongoing training.</li>
            </ol>
            The school and children benefit greatly as these trained volunteers support the teachers in their commitment
            to help
            children prepare for a successful future. In turn, the volunteers find they have an opportunity to give
            quality
            service to the school community and in doing so gain great personal rewards in helping "launch" children on
            a
            successful path.

            <h3>DEVELOPMENT STATEMENT</h3>
            The Launch Program was proposed for development in the spring of 1995 as a way to provide Kindergartners
            with a
            boost in learning.
            It is patterned after a successful program created by a Michigan woman, Florence Sharp, as a master's degree
            thesis.
            Her program was further developed by the Junior League of Minneapolis and became known as the Bucket
            Brigade.
            Many
            of the game ideas from this manual are from the Bucket Brigade and have been used successfully in over 100
            schools.
            It was their hope that these ideas would spread and reach many children.
            Ruth Odell, a special education teacher, incorporated these ideas with further research on the kindergarten
            child,
            tutoring techniques, and the mechanics of the program in the development of this Launch Manual. She piloted
            the
            Launch Program at McAuliffe Elementary in Sammamish, WA in January 1996 and then introduced Launch to
            Blackwell
            Elementary in Sammamish, WA in 1999.
            Launch is constantly evolving, and in 2023 the program has expanded to include First Grade.
            The Launch Program at Blackwell Elementary is supported by a grant from Blackwell PTSA.

            ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
            In all worthwhile endeavors, success depends on cooperation and coordination. No one individual can be as

            each

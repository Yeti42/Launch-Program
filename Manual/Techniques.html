THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN TUTORING:
START where the child feels comfortable and can be successful.
BUILD on what the child already knows.
REMEMBER — these students need small chunks of learning and lots of practice.
SUCCESS should be a part of every session. Be sure the child feels good about their accomplishments.
PRAISE, PRAISE, PRAISE!!! — Self-esteem is vital to success. If a child thinks they can, they can!

YOUR TUTORING STRATEGIES SHOULD:
BE GENTLE Kindergartners and First Graders tend to take things literally, do not use sarcasm or jokes. They may take time to process information — if necessary, slow your speech down.
BE NORMALIZED Provide the most natural environment, adapt the environment and interactions to meet the needs of the child, rather than forcing the child to fit the structured game format. The "right" way to play a game is the way that works for the child!
BE INDIVIDUALIZED Know the student's strengths through meaningful assessment.
PROVIDE CHOICE This nudges growth.
 
WHAT TO DO IF:
YOUR STUDENT IS EASILY DISTRACTED: 
●	maintain eye contact.
●	use gestures to emphasize points.
●	provide an environment away from distractions.
●	reduce the number of materials present by putting away all unnecessary items.
YOUR STUDENT ISN'T FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS:
●	give directions both verbally and visually.
●	model the activity.
●	Have the student explain directions back to you.
●	start the direction by calling the child's name and wait for eye contact.
YOUR STUDENT FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO TRANSITION FROM ONE ACTIVITY TO ANOTHER: 
●	give a warning a few minutes before the activity changes.
●	outline the day's activities at the beginning of the session, writing them on a card to be checked off.
YOUR STUDENT IS NON-COMPLIANT: 
●	establish eye contact.
●	do not "ask" the child to change behavior but rather "state" the direction (Ex. - "I need you to sit down." instead of "Will you please sit down?")
●	give the direction only twice, do not nag.
●	give only direction at a time E.g. - Do not ask the child to do many things such as, "Come here, sit down, stop talking, and put down the token."
●	state the direction in a soft but firm voice.
●	give the child time to comply (3-5 seconds). During this time do not converse, restate the direction, or state a different direction. Look at the child and wait for compliance.
●	make "start" directions instead of "directions" requests - make your directions descriptive and positive. For example, "Look at me." instead of "Pay attention!"
●	reinforce compliance, compliment positive behaviors.

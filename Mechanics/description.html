"LAUNCH" PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Launch Program is a volunteer tutoring program designed to help kindergarten and first grade children become more comfortable with number and letter recognition, beginning sounds, blends & digraphs, CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) words, and other pre reading and reading activities. The program supports the teacher to ensure each child is 'launched' on an educational path to success.
The Launch volunteer meets twice weekly for 15 minutes with each child. Skills are reinforced in a comfortable one-to-one setting using multi-sensory games carried by the volunteer. A communication notebook allows the teacher and volunteer to confidentially share insights and record progress.
This program has been successful in other schools as it combines several essential features:
1. Prevention - It is a program designed to help children who are identified by their classroom teacher as needing a boost. The emphasis is on twice-a-week, immediate help, before bad habits become firmly established.
2. Training - Volunteers are required to take a training class with a building professional. This training provides the volunteer with an overview of learning differences, tutoring techniques, and the importance of helping children develop a positive self-image.
3. Materials - The volunteers' supplies are hand-made games and aids which the well-trained volunteer uses creatively by adapting them to the individual needs of the child. Teacher preparation time is alleviated due to the autonomous nature of the program.
4. Support - The volunteers meet regularly with the Launch Coordinator in their school. This opportunity to exchange new ideas and concerns provides volunteer stimulation and ongoing training.
The school and children benefit greatly as these trained volunteers support the teachers in their commitment to help children prepare for a successful future. In turn, the volunteers find they have an opportunity to give quality service to the school community and in doing so gain great personal rewards in helping "launch" children on a successful path.

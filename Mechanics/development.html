DEVELOPMENT STATEMENT
The Launch Program was proposed for development in the spring of 1995 as a way to provide Kindergartners with a boost in learning.
It is patterned after a successful program created by a Michigan woman, Florence Sharp, as a master's degree thesis. Her program was further developed by the Junior League of Minneapolis and became known as the Bucket Brigade. Many of the game ideas from this manual are from the Bucket Brigade and have been used successfully in over 100 schools. It was their hope that these ideas would spread and reach many children.
Ruth Odell, a special education teacher, incorporated these ideas with further research on the kindergarten child, tutoring techniques, and the mechanics of the program in the development of this Launch Manual. She piloted the Launch Program at McAuliffe Elementary in Sammamish, WA in January 1996 and then introduced Launch to Blackwell Elementary in Sammamish, WA in 1999.
Launch is constantly evolving, and in 2023 the program has expanded to include First Grade. 
The Launch Program at Blackwell Elementary is supported by a grant from Blackwell PTSA.

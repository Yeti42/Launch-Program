THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN TUTORING:
START where the child feels comfortable and can be successful.
BUILD on what the child already knows.
REMEMBER — these students need small chunks of learning and lots of practice.
SUCCESS should be a part of every session. Be sure the child feels good about their accomplishments.
PRAISE, PRAISE, PRAISE!!! — Self-esteem is vital to success. If a child thinks they can, they can!

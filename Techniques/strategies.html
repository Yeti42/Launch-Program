YOUR TUTORING STRATEGIES SHOULD:
BE GENTLE Kindergartners and First Graders tend to take things literally, do not use sarcasm or jokes. They may take time to process information â€” if necessary, slow your speech down.
BE NORMALIZED Provide the most natural environment, adapt the environment and interactions to meet the needs of the child, rather than forcing the child to fit the structured game format. The "right" way to play a game is the way that works for the child!
BE INDIVIDUALIZED Know the student's strengths through meaningful assessment.
PROVIDE CHOICE This nudges growth.

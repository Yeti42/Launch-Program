WHAT TO DO IF:
YOUR STUDENT IS EASILY DISTRACTED: 
●	maintain eye contact.
●	use gestures to emphasize points.
●	provide an environment away from distractions.
●	reduce the number of materials present by putting away all unnecessary items.
YOUR STUDENT ISN'T FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS:
●	give directions both verbally and visually.
●	model the activity.
●	Have the student explain directions back to you.
●	start the direction by calling the child's name and wait for eye contact.
YOUR STUDENT FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO TRANSITION FROM ONE ACTIVITY TO ANOTHER: 
●	give a warning a few minutes before the activity changes.
●	outline the day's activities at the beginning of the session, writing them on a card to be checked off.
YOUR STUDENT IS NON-COMPLIANT: 
●	establish eye contact.
●	do not "ask" the child to change behavior but rather "state" the direction (Ex. - "I need you to sit down." instead of "Will you please sit down?")
●	give the direction only twice, do not nag.
●	give only direction at a time E.g. - Do not ask the child to do many things such as, "Come here, sit down, stop talking, and put down the token."
●	state the direction in a soft but firm voice.
●	give the child time to comply (3-5 seconds). During this time do not converse, restate the direction, or state a different direction. Look at the child and wait for compliance.
●	make "start" directions instead of "directions" requests - make your directions descriptive and positive. For example, "Look at me." instead of "Pay attention!"
●	reinforce compliance, compliment positive behaviors.
